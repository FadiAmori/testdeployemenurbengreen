# Admin Access Control Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the role-based access control system implemented to restrict admin dashboard and admin routes to users with the "admin" role only.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created CheckAdmin Middleware
**File**: `app/Http/Middleware/CheckAdmin.php`

This middleware checks if the authenticated user has the "admin" role:
- If user is not authenticated → redirects to login page
- If user role is not "admin" → returns 403 Forbidden error
- If user is admin → allows access to continue

```php
if (!Auth::check()) {
    return redirect()->route('login');
}

if (Auth::user()->role !== 'admin') {
    abort(403, 'Access denied. Admin privileges required.');
}
```

### 2. Registered Admin Middleware
**File**: `app/Http/Kernel.php`

Added the middleware to the `$middlewareAliases` array:
```php
'admin' => \App\Http\Middleware\CheckAdmin::class,
```

This allows us to use `'admin'` as a middleware alias in routes.

### 3. Protected Admin Routes
**File**: `routes/web.php`

All admin routes are now wrapped in a route group with both `auth` and `admin` middleware:

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => ['auth', 'admin']], function () {
    // All admin routes here
});
```

**Protected Routes Include:**
- `admin/shop/*` - Shop management dashboard
- `admin/notifications/*` - Notification management
- `admin/event/*` - Event management
- `admin/maintenance/*` - Maintenance product management
- `admin/shop-management/*` - Advanced shop management (products, categories, orders)
- `admin/blog` and `admin/statutes/*` - Blog/statute management
- `admin/comentes/*` - Comment management
- `admin/ai-report/*` - AI report generation
- `user-management/*` - User management routes

### 4. Dashboard Route
**File**: `routes/web.php` (line 186)

The `/dashboard` route uses only `auth` middleware (not `admin`):
```php
Route::get('/dashboard', [DashboardController::class, 'index'])->middleware('auth')->name('dashboard');
```

**Why?** The DashboardController has built-in logic to show different dashboards:
- Admin users → see admin dashboard with statistics (users, orders, products, events)
- Regular users → see user dashboard with their personal information (upcoming events, favorites, orders)

## Testing

### Test as Admin User
1. Log in with a user account that has `role = 'admin'` in the database
2. Navigate to `/dashboard` → Should see admin dashboard with statistics
3. Navigate to any `/admin/*` route → Should have full access

### Test as Regular User
1. Log in with a user account that has `role = 'user'` in the database
2. Navigate to `/dashboard` → Should see user dashboard (not admin dashboard)
3. Try to navigate to any `/admin/*` route → Should get **403 Forbidden** error
4. Example protected routes to test:
   - `/admin/shop`
   - `/admin/event`
   - `/admin/blog`
   - `/user-management`

### Test as Unauthenticated User
1. Log out or open incognito browser
2. Try to access any `/admin/*` route → Should redirect to login page
3. Try to access `/dashboard` → Should redirect to login page

## Security Features

✅ **Role-Based Access Control**: Only users with "admin" role can access admin routes
✅ **Authentication Required**: All admin routes require authentication first
✅ **403 Forbidden Response**: Clear error message when non-admin users try to access admin areas
✅ **Automatic Login Redirect**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to login page
✅ **No Bypass**: Middleware checks happen on every request

## User Experience

### For Admin Users
- Seamless access to all admin features
- Dashboard shows comprehensive statistics
- Full CRUD operations on all resources

### For Regular Users
- Clean separation from admin features
- User-focused dashboard with personal information
- Cannot accidentally navigate to admin routes
- Clear error message if they try to access admin areas

## Database Requirement

Users must have a `role` column in the `users` table with one of these values:
- `'admin'` - Full access to admin dashboard and routes
- `'user'` - Regular user with no admin access

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the access control system:
- Add more granular roles (e.g., "moderator", "editor")
- Implement permission-based access instead of just role-based
- Add audit logging for admin actions
- Create a role management interface for admins
- Add middleware to specific controller methods instead of just routes
